Swap Images SRC on a Website You're Viewing with Placeholders

A good portion of my web dev work is on things other than images. This bookmarklet helps
me stay focused on my work.

This is just about identical copy of the code from https://github.com/keccers/heygirl minus pictures of Gosling :-)

Pull Requests Welcome. Especially if they help swap videos and elements with background-url.
